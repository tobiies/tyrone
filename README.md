# tyrone
tyrone is a python script built to imitate a virtual assistant.

### features
as of now, tyrone can:
* roast
* say interesting factoids
* say hello and bye in different ways
* translate sentences
* play music (limited)
* tell riddles
* recite the date and time
* open the github
* tell you about himself
* show credits

**in order for tyrone to work to the best of his ability, make sure the "tyrone.py" + .wav files + the "translate" folder are in the same directory. without this, there may be errors encountered when attempting to play sound.**

more features are on the way.

**future additions
*more sound effects
*varying commands

*tyrone is a wip (work in progress).*
