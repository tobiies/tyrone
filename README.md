# tyrone
tyrone is a python script built to imitate a virtual assistant.

### features
as of now, tyrone can:
* roast
* say interesting factoids
* say hello and bye in different ways
* show credits
* play music (limited)
* tell riddles
* recite the date and time
* open the github
* tell you about himself

**in order for tyrone to work to the best of his ability, create a folder named "tyrone" and place tyrone.py + the wav files there. without this, there may be errors encountered when attempting to play sound.**

more features are on the way.

*tyrone is a wip (work in progress).*
